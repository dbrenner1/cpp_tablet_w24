            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>
            <p>Recipe Ingredients</p>
      
            <ul>
                <li>Cooking spray</li>
                <li>2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
                <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recipe Steps</p>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350º. Line a 9"-by-5" loaf pan with parchment and grease with cooking spray. 
                In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, and salt.
                In a large bowl, mix egg, egg yolk, granulated sugar, butter, sour cream, and vanilla. Add bananas and stir until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients to banana mixture until just combined. 
                Fold in walnuts and chocolate chips and transfer to prepared pan.
                Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool 10 minutes in pan, then invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely.

            <p>Recipe Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Vanilla</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>water</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Recipe Steps</p>
            <p>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.
                Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.
                Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more information about making ahead of time and storing in the refrigerator or freezer.
